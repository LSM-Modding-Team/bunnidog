# Apex — the culmination of a breeding line

The five legendary stat drops now fund a deliberate boss encounter. A Tissue
Sample supplies the look and original bred points; its living donor is never
changed or consumed. This completes the endgame idea in DESIGN.md without
allowing unbounded breeding points to break boss movement or health.

## Ritual

Craft an Apex Crucible: `OMO / ODO / OOO` (obsidian, Mutant Marrow, diamond).
Place five Trophy Pedestals at the same height around it. Valid ring slots are
three blocks north/east/south/west and two blocks along both axes diagonally.
Any five of the eight slots work. Display one of each: Titan Haunch, Gilded Foot,
Moon Sinew, Listening Shell and Everbloom. Extra duplicate displays are left alone.
Use a valid Tissue Sample on the crucible to summon its line's Apex above it.
Empty-hand use explains the ring. The five selected legends and one sample are
spent only after successful spawning; creative preserves them. Pedestals remain.

Require building permission, non-Peaceful difficulty, a loaded ring/spawn area,
dry collision-free space above the crucible and no living Apex within 48 blocks.
Refusal consumes nothing. No entity, terrain or container is cleared to make room.
The ritual has no ticking block entity, global search or automatic spawning.

## Encounter

The Apex retains all seven source gene pairs, coat/body proportions and expressed
environmental adaptations. The existing approved creature mesh is reused with
native Scale 1.8. Source points are retained separately from bounded boss
attributes: health 180–720, speed .25–.42, jump .4–.8, damage 8–15 and awareness
24–64. Build, legs, ears, Vitality, Swiftness, Leap and Senses affect these values.
Bloom remains an adult breeding stat, with no boss growth effect. A3 also
inherits the source's slate armor and stocky/chonker knockback resistance,
adding to base armor 4/resistance .5. The glow coat remains self-lit.

The persistent hostile boss hunts players and retaliates, with melee plus a
short warned pounce at range or stomp nearby. Charging stops navigation, plays
a warning and emits particles before acting; attacks do not edit blocks. Stomp
damages visible survival/adventure players in four blocks and throws them back.
Below half health the boss bar turns red, movement/damage increase within the
same caps and charges become shorter. A native boss bar follows tracked players.
Saved remaining ability recovery prevents reloads resetting the attack interval.

An Apex never claims a Nest, breeds, eats, accepts care tools, takes a lead or
boards a vehicle. Calipers give its current combat health and explain its crest.
It does not naturally despawn; switching to Peaceful removes it as a hostile mob.

## Reward and compatibility

A credited player kill drops one unstackable Epic Apex Crest, preserving the
exact original Tissue payload. It opens the source line's sheet and can be
displayed on an ordinary Trophy Pedestal. The boss does not roll ordinary
bunnidog materials or refund the five legends. Mob drops game rule applies.
The first player victory grants the Apex of the Line advancement (200 XP);
the boss itself grants 50 XP under native kill-credit rules.

Existing genome, animal saves, pedestal contents, model assets and protocol 6
remain compatible. The new entity uses existing genome sync and native boss
packets; the crest uses the existing tissue component.

## Evidence

Actual Gradle build and the native encounter case pass (fifteen mod scenarios
plus native sanity). It covers partial/blocked/active ritual refusals, successful
costs, exact source data and bounded attributes, immediate scaled dimensions,
care/transport/home refusal, enrage/health/recovery saves, warned stomp damage,
pounce motion, player-kill-only crest, advancement and native pedestal saves.
Headless model check passed during the batch; the approved mesh is unchanged.
Crucible/crest texture preview inspected (`art/apex_preview.png`).
Client encounter pacing, sounds, multiplayer and appearance need gameplay review.
